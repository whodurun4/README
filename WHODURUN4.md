# whodurun4 (who do you run for)

Both a question and a statement, whodurun4 has shaped me as a person by anchoring values, guiding vision and fueling motivation in my faith. I cooked up the corney saying as a teenager who had found his identity as a distance runner to focus my efforts and rest my mind.

Many years later I recognize I'm a flawed individual, I still see value as it reminds me to be accountable and graceful to others and even myself. I strive to improve and be aware of the ways I struggle so I can use that knowledge for the benefit of others I encounter.
