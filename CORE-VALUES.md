# Workplace Core Values

## Grace

Stand together and start here, supporting each other, recognizing our strengths, weaknesses and flaws, then grow, overcome challenges and succeed as a team.

Grace is accountability enabled through integrity and empowerment. Integrity, trust and accountability are critical enablers. Without them, grace is naive and exploited.

Trust enables effective communication and teamwork while integrity and accountability enable trust. True empowerment and most growth come through grace.

## Mutual Respect

Worthwhile projects require hard decisions. Mutual respect is a critical enabler of good decision making.

Encourage constructive discussion and disagreement from a variety of perspectives.

Appropriately weighs input from those needing consulted.

Work productively to align and support decisions once made.

## Teamwork

Selflessness: all efforts ultimately serve the goals of the team, at times by prioritizing individual development.

Success comes through servant leadership. I succeed by enabling our team to succeed.

## Omnidirectional Investment

Omnidirectional investment between the team, organization, product and myself is a key enabler of high-performing teams. Many call this engagement, but I prefer the financial implications of omnidirectional investment to communicate the cost in terms of money, time, energy and buy-in.

* I invest in our team, the product and organization.
* Leadership and the organization invest in the team, myself and the product.
* The team invests in each other, the organization and the product.

I strive to build a culture of working hard and having a good time doing it, but work-life balance is just as critical an investment. My focus is on short and especially long term well-being of team members and loved ones.

## Joy

Work is not the purpose of my life, but I want to bring joy to others I encounter and those who use what I build while enjoying those I work with, the work we do and what weâ€™re building.

Joy is not a fleeting feel-good bit of happiness, but deeply-rooted, sustaining and energizing.
